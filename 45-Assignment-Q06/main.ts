// Q6. Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters
// at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each
// character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once,
// so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

let pName: string = "UmarFarooq";
console.log(pName);
let prName: string = "Umar\tFarooq";
console.log(prName);
let prsName: string = "Umar\nFarooq";
