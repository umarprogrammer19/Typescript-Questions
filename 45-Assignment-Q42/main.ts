// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding
// the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to
// see that the list has actually been modified.

function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[] {

}

// Define the array of magicians
const magicians: string[] = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Penn Jillette"];

// Call makeGreat() to modify the array
const greatMagicians: string[] = make_great(magicians);

// Print the modified list of magicians
console.log(greatMagicians);
