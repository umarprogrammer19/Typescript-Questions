// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding
// the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to
// see that the list has actually been modified.
function make_great(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (magician) { return "TheGreat ".concat(magician); });
}
// Define the array of magicians
var magicians = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Penn Jillette"];
// Call makeGreat() to modify the array
var greatMagicians = make_great(magicians);
// Print the modified list of magicians
console.log(greatMagicians);
