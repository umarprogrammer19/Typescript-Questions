// 10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
// If you don’t have anything specific to write
// because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
// describing what the program does.
// My Name is Umar Farooq 
// My Number is 0317 2472531
var num1 = 1;
var num2 = 21;
var sum = num1 + num2;
console.log("The Sum of num1 and num2 is ".concat(sum));
// in this program we declare and initialize two variables with some numbers and in third variable 
// we added them and then we display the sum of these vars as a result in console
